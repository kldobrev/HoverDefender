A ground/air horizontal shooter for the Nintendo Game Boy, written in C using the following tools:

[GBDK 2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) <br />
[GBTD and GBMB](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/GBTD_GBMB) <br />
[HUGETracker](https://nickfa.ro/index.php/HUGETracker) <br />
[hUGEDriver](https://github.com/SuperDisk/hUGEDriver) <br />

### To compile the code

1. Get GBDK-2020 and hUGEDriver, install and configure them as described in their pages
2. Edit the lcc (gbdk\bin) and include (hUGEDriver\include) paths in the make file to match their directories on your machine.
3. Run the make file and the included gb rom with the code will be replaced with the new one.

### Only want to play the game?

Please get the hoverdefender.gb file from the demo release which offers a full playable stage.
The latest .gb file from the project directory may contain work in progress and/or be unplayable.

I strongly recommend using the BGB or Emulicious emulators to run the game.
